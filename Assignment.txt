//Difference between length and length():

Ans-The length is an instance variable of an array in Java .The length is an instance variable of an array in Java .
-Once arrays are initialized, its length cannot be changed, so the length variable can directly be used to get the length of an array.
-The length variable is used only for an array.

length():
-length() is a method of String class.
-The length() returns the length of a string object i.e. the number of characters stored in an object.
-String class uses this method because the length of a string can be modified using the various operations on an object.
-The String class internally uses a char[] array that it does not expose to the outside world.

//Q2)Multiple Inheritance
Multiple Inheritance in Java: 
Defining derived class from numerous base classes is known as ‘Multiple Inheritance’. 
In this case, there is more than one superclass, and there can be one or more subclasses. 
Multiple inheritances are available in object-oriented programming with C++, but it is not available in Java. 
Java developers want to use multiple inheritances in some cases.
 Fortunately, Java developers have interface concepts expecting the developers to achieve multiple inheritances by using multiple interfaces. 
Ex: class Myclass implements interface1, interface2,…. 
ex. 
class A10{  
void msg(){
	System.out.println("Hello");
	}  
}  
class B{  
void msg(){
	System.out.println("Welcome");
	}  
}  
class C extends A,B {
   public static void main(String args[]){  
   C obj=new C();  
   obj.msg();
}  
}  
Q3)Hybrid Inheritance
Hybrid Inheritance in Java: 
Hybrid Inheritance in Java is a combination of Inheritances. 
In this type of Inheritance, more than one kind of inheritance is observed.
For example, if we have class A and class B that extend class C and then there is another class D that extends class A, then this type of Inheritance is known as Hybrid Inheritance.
Why? Because we clearly observe that there is two kinds of inheritance here- Hierarchical and Single Inheritance.
In the diagram shown below, we see another example of Hybrid Inheritance.
